# Real Time Traffic Incident Visualization

## Project Function
The purpose of this project is to visualize real-time traffic incidents in the Northern Virginia Area.
A frequent problem faced by both individual travelers and navigation applications is the unexpected nature and high-impact effect of traffic incidents. When a traffic incident occurs—be it roadwork, an accident, or a naturally occurring traffic jam—routes and arrival times can be significantly affected. The goal of this project is to solve the problem of identifying and analyzing these incidents by visualizing their location and impact in order to improve navigation planning.

Dataset: Briefly describe your dataset

Pipeline / Architecture: Which pipeline did you use? Which tools?

Data Quality Assessment: Describe the quality status of the data set and the way you assessed it

Data Transformation Models used: Briefly describe the transformations and models used

and final results that you were able to achieve. If there are any special instructions needed to execute your code (e.g., signing up to a specific API to access the dataset that is needed) those need to be listed as well.

Infographic: A simple infographic describing the architecture of your data pipeline including datasets, storage, and tools used along with another final infographic describing the results of the engineering task accomplished. Examples can be provided if needed.

Thorough Investigation: This critically assesses the viability of your idea: Based on the results of this project (your pilot project, your prototype, etc), from a technical leadership point of view, what are your conclusions or recommendations for continuing this project in terms of scaling it up? How would you assess the innovativeness of your project? Any technical or platform concerns, difficulties, or limitations of the pipeline for the project? Based on your experience and results, what next step would you recommend to take this project to the next level/phase?
